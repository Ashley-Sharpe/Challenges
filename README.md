GoldBadge_Challenges
These are all the challenges that I got to. Craig stayed up with me for 2 nights and this is all I could complete. 
I understand its probably not enough but I wanted to show that I did put the effort in. 

All the challenges can be added to , deleted , and viewed in their respective UI's , and updated where appropriate. 

Build status : the first two challenge builds are totally done but the 3rd i could not finish adapting (i copy pasted my first project and was updating it)

Standard coding style

Tests : I didn't get to any tests.

How to use:
Start the UI and follow along with the prompts to - add / delete / update information in the cafe / Greetings / Insurance module.

Credits : 
Craig and Ian for literally helping me for the past couple days and you guys for believing in me . Sorry I just burnt out too much after pulling an all nighter and it wasn't working .
